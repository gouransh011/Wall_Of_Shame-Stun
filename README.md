# Wall of Shame 
This is a simple platform where developers can post code snippets they are not proud of, along with a short confession. Other users can view these snippets and leave comments.

The app is anonymous and does not require any login.

---

## What it does

- Post a snippet of bad code along with a confession
- Anyone can view all snippets on the wall
- Click on a snippet to read or leave comments
- Only the person who posted can delete their own snippet/comment
- A profile page that shows everything you've posted from your browser

## How identity works (no login required)

When you open the app, your browser gets assigned a random ID and saved in `localStorage`.  
That ID is sent along whenever you post something — so the app knows it's you without needing a username or password.

## Screenshots

**The Wall — posting and viewing snippets (your own browser)**  
Each card shows the confession, the bad code, and a "View Comments" button.  
The "Delete Snippet" button only appears on snippets posted from your browser.

**Same wall opened in a different browser**  
No delete buttons visible — ownership is tied to the browser that posted it.
